<h1>Weather, Pollution Prediction and Ozone
Level Detection Using ML</h1>
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>In this project, prediction of weather and
air pollution along with ozone level detection is to
be done. Although many factors combine to influence
weather, but the major contribution is done by
parameters such as temperature, heat index, dew
point etc. Air quality is majorly determined by
pollutants such as SO2, NO2, PM2.5, PM10 etc.
The prediction is done on the basis of historical
data. Ozone variability and trends are dependent
on temperature, wind speed, humidity,
precipitation to determine whether a day is Ozone
day or Non-Ozone day. The results will show the
effectiveness of Machine Learning techniques when
predicting the weather and pollution.</p>
